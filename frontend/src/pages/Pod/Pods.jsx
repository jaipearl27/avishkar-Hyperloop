          <h2>Pod 6.0 | Garuda</h2>
          <p>Avishkar has been working on Hyperloop pod technologies for over 6 years now, and has been working relentlessly to develop scalable and frugal technologies for the Indian Hyperloop. Avishkar's pod Garuda is propelled by a Linear induction Motor designed completely in-house, which is also the podâ€™s primary mode of braking. The pod incorporates bidirectional run capabilities and EMS levitation with a high lift-to-weight ratio while still being extremely power efficient. The pod is controlled with autonomous embedded systems capable of speed and direction control and real-time data acquisition. This technological marvel will soon be tested inside our very own 400m vacuum tube facility, thereby proving the concept of Hyperloop.</p>
